/*
 nonatomic vs. atomic - "atomic" is the default. Always use "nonatomic". I don't know why, but the book I read said there is "rarely a reason" to use "atomic". (BTW: The book I read is the BNR "iOS Programming" book.)
 
 readwrite vs. readonly - "readwrite" is the default. When you @synthesize, both a getter and a setter will be created for you. If you use "readonly", no setter will be created. Use it for a value you don't want to ever change after the instantiation of the object.
